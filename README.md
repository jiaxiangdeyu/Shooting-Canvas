# ShootingCanvas
ShootingCanvas project

This is a java swing demo for shooting calibration and it can be modified to a simple painting panel easily.

ShootingGame.java has the main function.

All 2D shapes will be drawn on CanvasPanel object.

That's all and I should finish this readme file later.
